Overview
--------

Adder takes two arrays as arguments. Those arrays contains arrays which have a structure in which each item has a specific meaning:
 
     constrain - number
     exponential - number
     term - [ constrain, exponential ]
     expression/argument - [ term, term, ... ]
 
example:
   
    2x^2 + 3 = [ [2, 2], [3] ]
    3x^3 + x^2 = [ [3,3], [1,2] ]
 
The return value is an object  each key is Exponential (and c when term without Variable - [constant term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_term) and value is Constant.

```js
 const result = expressionAdder(
  // 2x^2 + 3
  [ [2, 2], [3] ],
  // 3x^3 + x^2  
  [ [3,3], [1,2] ]
);

debugger;

// 3x^3 + 3x^2 + 3
result; // { "2": 3, "3": 3, "c": 3 }
```
